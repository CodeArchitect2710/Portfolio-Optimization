## EXECUTIVE SUMMARY

This project presents a comprehensive analysis of machine learning applications in portfolio optimization, comparing three distinct prediction methodologies against traditional investment strategies. The research demonstrates the integration of advanced machine learning techniques with quantitative finance principles to create intelligent investment systems that balance return maximization with risk management.

The study utilizes a dataset of 382 S&P 500 stocks spanning approximately 20 years, implementing moving average, linear regression with PCA, and LSTM neural network approaches to predict stock prices and optimize portfolio allocations. The results provide valuable insights into the effectiveness of machine learning in financial markets and the importance of model selection in algorithmic trading.
